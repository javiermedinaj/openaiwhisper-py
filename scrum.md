All right, get ready because today we're going deep on Agile Project Management with Scrum.

Ooh, sounds intense.

It is, but in a good way.

Yeah. I've been looking over those excerpts you sent from Diego Martin Alamos book, Preyectos Agiles Con Scrum. Great book.

It is. And it seems Agile is everywhere these days.

Yeah, it's definitely a hot topic. But this deep dive is about more than just buzzwords, you know. We're going to uncover what really makes Agile and Scrum tick.

I like it getting past the hype and into the nitty gritty.

Exactly. What really stands out to me about Scrum is how it tackles complexity.

Yeah, that's a big one. The kind of uncertainty that would make a traditional project manager, well, freak out a little.

Right, because it's all about being flexible, adapting to change, which is like the opposite of how many projects are run.

Totally. It's like having a toolbox specifically designed for navigating the chaos of software development. Have you ever seen a project go off the rails because they clung to a rigid plan?

Oh, absolutely. Happens all the time. In fact, I was reading about this company that tried to build a new app using the old waterfall method. So no total disaster spent months planning every little detail. But by the time they were ready to launch, the market had changed.

Exactly. User needs had evolved. Technology had moved on and their app was basically obsolete before it even hit the app store.

Ouch. That's a painful lesson.

It is. And it perfectly illustrates why agile methodologies like Scrum came about in the first place. So it's not just about speed, right? It's about being adaptable.

Exactly. Think about building a bridge. You need that rock solid plan from the start. No room for improvisation. Can't really change the design midway. But software suffers more like building a boat, but in the middle of the ocean.

Okay. I like where this is going.

You've got waves. You're discovering new islands. That's charted territories. You've got to constantly adjust your course. Be ready for anything.

That's a fantastic analogy. So how does Scrum help teams navigate those choppy waters?

Well, one key thing is understanding the problem we're dealing with. Alamo talks about the Sinefin framework.

I remember that.

Yeah. It's like a map of complexity. Scrum works best in that complex domain where things are unpredictable. So instead of assuming you can plan everything upfront, Scrum acknowledges you're going to hit those unexpected challenges.

Exactly. And that's why it's a framework, not a rigid methodology. It gives you principles and guidelines, but you adapt them to your specific situation.

Okay. So embracing uncertainty is key. What does that look like in practice, though?

Well, the heart of Scrum is these short cycles called sprints, usually two to four weeks long.

Sprints, right. I've heard that term thrown around.

And each sprint kicks off with a sprint planning meeting, where the team decides what features to work on.

Incrementally, little by little. And each sprint results in a potentially shippable product increment.

Right. Boom. That's the goal. Something tangible, something you could release if it made sense.

I see. So it's like constantly checking in, making sure you're on the right track.

Exactly. And that feedback loop is crucial. After that sprint planning meeting, the team breaks those features down into smaller tasks.

More manageable chunks.

Right. And they have daily Scrum meetings, just quick check-ins to stay aligned, talk about any roadblocks.

Like a daily pulse check.

I like that. Make sure everyone's on the same page. And then at the end of the sprint, you have the big reveal.

Not quite a reveal, but close. You have the sprint review and the sprint retrospective.

Oh, get two different things.

The review is where the team shows off their work, gets feedback from stakeholders. Then the retrospective is more inward looking. The team reflects on their process, figures out what they can improve.

I see. So it's about learning and adapting, making each sprint better.

Exactly. Alamo calls it evolutionary development. Learning that boat piece by piece.

Exactly. He also has this analogy about building a bus, you know. Instead of trying to build the whole thing at once.

You start small.

Yeah. Maybe just a chassis and wheels. Then you add stuff, refine things based on feedback.

And make sure your passengers like it.

Absolutely. And that brings us to the minimum viable product, the MVP. Get something out there fast. Learn from it.

Exactly. Don't waste time building something nobody wants.

Do I ever tell you about this food delivery startup I read about?

Tell me.

They launched with this super basic MVP, just a few restaurants, small area.

To test the waters.

Exactly. Got feedback from early users, figured out what worked, then expanded based on that.

Smart move.

It is. But you'd be surprised how many companies are still stuck in that old waterfall mindset. Trying to plan everything down to the minute.

Yep. And then getting blindsided by change.

The companies that thrive are the ones that embrace this agile way of thinking. The ones who can roll with the punches, adapt to new information.

Exactly. So we've covered a lot in this first part of our deep dive from the limits of waterfall to the heart of scrum. The importance of the MVP, those short sprints with built-in feedback loops. We've even touched on the product owner, the scrum master, the development team, a whole scrum team. But there's so much more to uncover.

Oh, yeah, we're just getting started. In part two, we'll dive into those agile estimations. Three points, planning poker. All the fun stuff.

It's going to get interesting.

Can't wait.

  Welcome back. We were just talking about how scrum teams need to be super flexible, right? Like navigating a maze that keeps changing its walls. That's a good one. But then how do you estimate and plan for a project when you know things are going to shift? Yeah, it seems like a contradiction, planning for the unpredictable. Right. But that's where agile estimations come in. Remember Alimo mentioning the cone of uncertainty? Vagely. Something about how accurate we can be with predictions. Exactly. It's this visual that shows how the more we know about a project, the better our predictions get. So at the beginning, it's a wide range of possibilities, a lot of unknowns. Totally. Like trying to predict where a river will flow on a mountain. Too many variables. So you're saying forget those detailed hour by hour estimates. Forget them. Agile is all about relative estimation, comparing the size and complexity of tasks using story points. Okay. So you're saying this task is twice as big as that one. You got it. Without getting barked down in the exact hours. And I remember Alimo talking about different levels of estimation. You start with those big chunks, the the epics, right? Right. The big picture stuff. You estimate those using general sizes, small, medium, large, like organizing your closet. Sure. It's pants, dresses, you know, the category. That's it. You don't need to count every item yet. Just get a sense of the volume. And then as things progress, you get more specific. Exactly. Those epics get broken down to user stories, the smaller pieces that deliver value to the user. Individual features. Right. And that's where those story points come in for estimation. And he uses the Fibonacci sequence, right? I remember that one, two, three, five, eight, thirteen. Why that specific sequence? Well, it kind of mirrors how uncertainty grows as things get bigger. It's easier to say a one point story is smaller than a two point story. But as you get to eight, thirteen, it's harder to be super precise. Exactly. It builds that cone of uncertainty right into the estimation. I like that. So estimations are more like educated guesses, right? Not set in stone. Exactly. And to make this whole thing more fun, a lot of teams use planning poker. Planning poker. That sounds kind of cool. It is. It's all about getting the team involved, tapping into their collective knowledge. So everyone gets cards with the Fibonacci numbers. Yep. And the product owner describes a user story. Then everyone secretly chooses a card with their estimate. And then big reveal. Big reveal. All cards on the table. And when there are differences. That's where the real discussion starts. You got it. People explain their thinking, share their perspectives. It's not about being right or wrong. It's about understanding. So much better than one person dictating estimates. Absolutely. The team owns it. But now, okay, you have your estimates. How do you actually plan your sprints? Alamo talks about velocity-based and commitment-based planning, right? Right. So velocity is all about looking at the past. How many story points did the team complete in previous sprints? Like a team's average score in basketball. Perfect analogy. Alamo bars that from my coom. But just like in basketball, a team's velocity can fluctuate. Depends on the game, the players, all sorts of things. Exactly. Same with projects, complexity of work, unexpected challenges, team dynamics. So velocity is useful, but not an absolute rule. And that's where commitment-based planning comes in. The team decides what they can realistically achieve. Considering all the factors, not just a number. Exactly. It's about owning the sprint, making informed commitments. So now we've got sprints planned. But how do we look at larger releases? Well, Alamo uses that training course management system as an example, right? Yeah. Release planning is about mapping those user stories onto a timeline, across multiple sprints. Like a road map. But with the understanding, it might change. Exactly. As we've been saying, change is a given. The road map guides you, but you adjust as needed. Exactly. That's the beauty of agile. But of course, we've got to be practical, right? We need to talk about costs. Alamo breaks down the typical costs, salaries, infrastructure, stuff like that. Yeah. And cost estimation is important. But in Scrum, it's not just about staying under budget. It's about making sure those costs translated to value for the users. You got it. Finding that balance between delivering a great product and being mindful of the resources. So it's not just being cheap. It's about being smart with those resources. Right on. We've talked about the nuts and bolts of estimations, but there's something deeper here, isn't there? The philosophy, the values that drive agile. Exactly. In the final part of our deep dive, we'll explore what makes Scrum more than just a set of techniques. We'll get into the heart of it, how it fosters collaboration, innovation, all that good stuff. Looking forward to it. So we spent a lot of time on the how of Scrum, the sprints, the estimations, all those tools and techniques. But I'm really curious about the why. What's the deeper philosophy driving all of this? Yeah, you're right. It's not just about the mechanics. It's about a mindset, a way of thinking. Remember those four values from the agile man, Festo? Oh, yeah. I remember those being important. Yeah. Refresh my memory on exactly what they are again. Okay. So the agile manifesto says we value individuals and interactions over processes and tools, working software over comprehensive documentation, customer collaboration, over contract negotiation and responding to change over following a plan. Right. That's it. It's about being adaptable, putting people first. Exactly. And in today's world, that's more important than ever. Things change so fast. Yeah. If you're stuck to a rigid plan, you're in trouble. It's like trying to navigate a city with an old map. You got to be able to find new routes, deal with detours, you know? Adjels like having a GPS that updates in real time. I like that. It's about being responsive, navigating that constant change. Okay. So how does this philosophy play out in a scrum team? How does it impact their work? Well, one big thing is this idea of continuous improvement. You're never done. You're always learning, always getting better. Like those sprint retrospectives we talked about. Yeah. They're more than just what went wrong sessions. Right. It's about asking, how can we be even better next sprint? It creates a space for honest feedback. Everyone's voice matters. It's not about blame. It's about growing as a team. Exactly. And it ties back to that agile value of individuals and interactions over processes and tools. Real magic happens when people collaborate. Working together towards a shared goal. Right. Scrum knows that a motivated team is way more powerful than individuals working in silos. It's about building trust, being transparent. And that sense of ownership. People work better when they feel valued, when they have a stake in the outcome. I've seen that in so many teams. When people feel trusted, they're more creative, more willing to go the extra mile. It's motivating. And Scrum builds that right into the structure. You mean the self organizing aspect? Yeah. Teams making decisions together, not just taking orders. Exactly. The Scrum Master guides the team, helps remove obstacles, but it's not about top down control. It's a different kind of leadership. Facilitation, empowerment, creating an environment where innovation can happen. So it's not just about efficiency. It's about unleashing the potential of the team. You got it. Creating a culture of learning, adapting, and collaboration. Wow. It's amazing how much we've uncovered in this deep dive. Thanks to those excerpts you shared from Preyactose Agilease, Con Scrum. It's been fun. It has. We've really gone beyond the buzzwords and got to the heart of what makes Agilean Scrum so effective. Especially in a world that's constantly changing. Absolutely. It's a framework for navigating complexity, for embracing change, for putting people first. And those are lessons we can all take to heart in any field. Couldn't agree more. Whether you're building software, planning a project, or just trying to achieve something in your life, these principles can be incredibly powerful. So to wrap things up, we encourage you to experiment, to try some of these ideas out, and see how they can help you navigate the complexity of your own world. And who knows, you might discover some innovative solutions along the way. Thanks for joining us on the deep dive. Until next time, keep learning, keep adapting, and keep pushing the boundaries of what's possible.
